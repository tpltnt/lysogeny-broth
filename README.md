Substrate for cellular automata in Rust.
Named after [Wilhelm Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Roux).
The underlying grid is of toroidal shape, i.e. the coordinate
values/neighbours wrap around.

# examples
* retrieve value as grid: `cargo run --example retrieval`
* implementation of rule 30: `cargo run --example rule30`
